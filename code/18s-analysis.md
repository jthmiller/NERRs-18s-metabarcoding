Longitudinal analysis can occur on features (ASVs), taxonomic assignment, or on phylogenetic clusters.

Compositional Tensor Factorization (CTF) 

## Treat each NERR_SITE as a subject
## Treat each NERR_SITE_QTR as a time

## volatility
## The volatility visualizer generates interactive line plots that allow us to assess how volatile a dependent variable is over a continuous, independent variable (e.g., time) in one or more groups. 

Multiple metadata files (including alpha and beta diversity artifacts) and FeatureTable[RelativeFrequency] tables can be used as input, and in the interactive visualization we can select different dependent variables to plot on the y-axis.

## incorporates information from the same host across multiple samples to reveal patterns driving differences in microbial composition across phenotypes. CTF identifies robust patterns in sparse compositional datasets, allowing for the detection of microbial changes associated with specific phenotypes that are reproducible across datasets.
